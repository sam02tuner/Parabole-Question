Technique:
1. First, try to tokenize the words from the sentence, using NLTK
2. Then, try to find the postion of the particular token in the sentence frame, i.e, noun, pronoun etc. This was also done by NLTK.
3. Then, find out the Proper noun, noun and the singular noun and feed them into a final list for each of the paragraph.
4. Then, try to map between two similar list that contains only the elements that present into the final list.
Future mapping not done due to not knowing that concept.
